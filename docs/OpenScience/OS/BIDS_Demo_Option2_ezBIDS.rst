In the last tutorial, we walked through converting data to BIDS using dcm2bids, a BIDS conversion tool that, like most BIDS conversion tools, requires a bit of programming knowledge/expertise. Given how large the neuroimaging community is, it is to be expected that a sizable continent of researchers do not have much familiarity with programming, let alone working knowledge of specific BIDS conversion tools.
